# rs-file-explorer

A minimal file explorer built with rust and egui (eframe framework).
`app.rs` Contains the app logic (i.e. file system stuff), and `gui.rs` handles user interface.

## File size

By using the release profile and compressing with upx, I've managed to get the binary down to 2.5 Mb.
